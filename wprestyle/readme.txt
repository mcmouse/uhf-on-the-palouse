Theme Features:
		1) Custom home page with multiple features:
			a: Call To Action section - Uses Site Title as heading.
			b: Service boxes
			c: Blog feed grid layout - no sidebar on frontpage/blog feed.
			d: Jetpack Portfolio support built in.
			e: Multiple separate sidebars for pages, portfolio and single posts.

		2) Bootstrap 3.2 powered.
		3) Sectionalized with option to show/hide specific sections.
		4) Child theme ready - will be releasing some soon.
		
This is the lite version of the theme with minimal options - premium version will include options to switch backgrounds/colors for the various sections,
multiple color selectors for the various elements (via an enhanced customizer section) plus much much more...

Known Limitations:

Menu: Site menu does not display by default - you will need to allocate a menu to the theme location.

Notes: Although this theme works perfectly out of the box, it is highly recommended using the JetPack plugin to compliment it and make it really shine!
Please also note that the Portfolio option section in the Customizer will only be visible if Jetpack is active!
